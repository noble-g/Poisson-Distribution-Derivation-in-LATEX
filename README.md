## Poisson-Distribution-Proving
Deriving mean and variance of a poisson distribution from its probability mass function (PMF). This is a LATEX project as well as a poisson distribution project, helping me practice the provings of poisson distributions I have learnt in my days as a statistics student of University of Ilorin.

From my note back in school
